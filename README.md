### <b>Authors</b>: Khashiff K. Miranda (corresponding), Brooke L. Weigel, Emily C. Fogarty, Iva A. Veseli, Anne E. Giblin, A. Murat Eren, Catherine A. Pfister

<br>
This folder contains files and workflows used in describing novel microbial communities living on the surfaces and in the rhizomes of marine coastal phototrophs in the Pacific NorthEast Ocean. Sampling was conducted on Tatoosh Island (Makah Tribe, WA, USA) and at West Falmouth Harbor (MA, USA).
